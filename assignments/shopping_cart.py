# #Have menu system that repeats until the user chooses quit.
# Create a list that will store the names of the items in the shopping cart.
# Complete the option to add the name of the item to the list.
# Complete the option to display the names of the items in the list.
# Store prices as well as names.
# Change the add functionality to also ask for and store the price of the item.
# Change the display functionality to also display the prices of the items.
# When displaying the items, display a number in front of each item. The numbers should start with 1.
# Complete the option to display the total amount of the prices of all the items in the shopping cart.
# Whenever prices are displayed, they should be shown to two decimal places and include the appropriate currency symbol(for example $, â‚¬, etc.)
# Complete the option to remove an item from the shopping cart.
# When removing an item, you should verify the following:
# Both the item name and price are removed from their respective lists.
# The number the user enters should be converted to a 0-based index and checked to make sure it is within the bounds of the list.
# The program allows you to remove any item from the list including the first one and the last one. (Sometimes, if you have a bug in your project you might not allow removing the last item as you should.)
